# Project Detail Summary
As this is my first experience at coding a multiplayer game, I was not able to meet all the requirements provided. However, I will make sure to learn more on what I have used here and improve my future projects. Thank you for this opportunity.

This project was built with CSS, HTML and javascript. I learnt and used node.js, express.js and socket.io for the server side.

I decided not to use GitLab pipeline CI/CD as I am still not familiar with the concept.

Through this project I felt that I learnt a lot and really enjoyed the process of learning this express framework and I hope you will take int consideration that it is my first time coding out a project which includes networking.
